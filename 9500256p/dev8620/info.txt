	Compiling and Loading the Device Driver Module

        i)   Copy the Apc8620 device driver routines from the "dev8620"
             directory of the source media to a new directory  under
             /home/ip/dev8620.
             Copy   the  carrier   support  routines  from  the
             "carrier" directory  of the  source  media  to  a  new
             directory  under   /home/ip/carrier. 

        ii)  Create device nodes for each carrier in the /dev directory using
             "mknod apc8620_0 c 46 0" 	(1st carrier)
             "mknod apc8620_1 c 46 1" 	(2nd carrier)
             "mknod apc8620_2 c 46 2" 	(3rd carrier)
             "mknod apc8620_3 c 46 3" 	(4th carrier)
             The command line items are as follows:
             apc8620_x - Device name x = minor number 0 - 3. 
             c       - Character device driver.
             46      - Major number defined in the device driver file.
             x       - Minor number 0 to 3.

             To create persistent device nodes for Acromag PCI board products.
             Edit your '/etc/rc.d/rc.local' as follows:
             #Acromag Apc8620
             if [ ! -r /dev/apc8620_0 ]; then
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/apc8620_0 c 46 0 #(1st carrier)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/apc8620_1 c 46 1 #(2nd carrier)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/apc8620_2 c 46 2 #(3rd carrier)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/apc8620_3 c 46 3 #(4th carrier)
             fi

        iii) Use the makefile to build the project.

        iv)  As 'root' load the module by using the insmod utility 
             "insmod /home/ip/dev8620/apc8620.ko".

        v)   Go to one of the ipxxx directories and see the infoxxx.txt
             file for information about compiling demonstration programs.

        vi)  Other carrier device instances can be obtained by changing
             parameter 1 of CarrierOpen().

             if(CarrierOpen(2, &c_block.nHandle) != S_OK) opens third device.


 
Note: If a "irq xxx: nobody cared" is reported when the board generates an interrupt, try
adding one of the following boot line options; "irqpoll", "acpi=off", or "pci=noacpi"
to the kernel boot line in file boot\grub\grub.conf (see below).
